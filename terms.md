As part of the Velas platform development, Velas has also made available the Velas wallet, which is a beta version of the software application for managing Velas blockchain digital wallets through the web interface available at:[ https://wallet.velas.com/](https://wallet.velas.com/), and through Velas wallet browser extensions, iOS, Android and desktop applications that may be made available by Velas from time to time (the “**Velas Wallet**”).

3.2.     	For a more detailed description of the proposed Velas platform, please refer to the Velas’s Website, Velas’s Blue Paper and Technical Paper, as may be amended from time to time (Velas’s Blue Paper and Technical Paper collectively, the “**Project Documentation**”).

As consideration for your obligations contained in these T&Cs and arising hereunder, Velas provides you with the right to participate in the Token swap and right to receive New tokens, as defined below, subject to and on the terms provided in these T&Cs, as well as other promises and covenants contained in these T&Cs.


        **5.** 	**TOKEN SWAP**

5.1.     	Token swap (the “**Token swap**”) shall mean the exchange of the current Velas tokens (the “**Current token**”) for the new Velas platform native tokens ‘VLX2’ issued on the new version of Velas blockchain (the “**New token**” or “**VLX2**”) through the Velas Wallet.

5.2.     	Token swap shall be final, no refunds and cancellations shall be available to you or any other person, unless Velas, in its sole and absolute discretion, decides otherwise.

5.3.     	The exchange rate between the Current tokens and the New tokens shall be 1:1 (one to one), meaning that per each Current token that you swap you may be entitled to receive one New token, subject to and on the terms and conditions herein contained.

5.4.     	New tokens shall be issued on the new version of the Velas blockchain that is different to the blockchain on which the Current tokens are circulating. Therefore, as part of the Token swap you will have to deliver Current tokens on the old version of Velas blockchain, and the New tokens will be issued and delivered to you on the new version of the Velas blockchain, subject to the terms contained herein.

ALL TOKENS SURRENDERED BY YOU FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TOKEN SWAP MAY BE BURNED, DEACTIVATED OR OTHERWISE INVALIDATED. FURTHER, STARTING FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE VELAS MAY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, LOCK, DEACTIVATE, BURN OR OTHERWISE INVALIDATE ANY CURRENT TOKENS HELD BY YOU, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION.

        **17.**  **TAXATION**

17.1.

18.1.  	In order to participate in the Token swap, we may collect personal data from you including, but not limited to, information and documents listed in Clause 18.2 below. This data is collected, processed, and stored in order to allow you to participate in the Token swap. All personal data collected in connection with these T&Cs shall be collected, processed, and stored in accordance with this Article 18, unless otherwise is required by applicable law and regulations, including the Federal Act on Data Protection of Switzerland and General Data Protection Regulation (for the purposes of this Article 18 collectively, the “**Applicable laws and regulations**”).

18.2.  	In order to conduct the Tokens swap, Velas may collect personal data (the “**Personal data**”) relating to:


            (i)   	your Digital wallet address;


            (ii)  	your IP address;


            (iii) 	your email address;


            (iv)	other personal information that you choose to provide us with.

18.3.  	Personal Data stipulated in Clause 18.2(i) above is process on the basis of the performance of the contract with you, i.e. these T&C. The Personal data stipulated in Clauses 18.2(ii) and 18.2(iii) is processed in accordance with our legitimate interest to identify your country of residence, contact you regarding the Token swap and help you with your inquiry or request.

18.4.  	Velas is the data controller of your Personal data collected in connection with the Token swap. Any inquiry regarding the protection of your Personal data may be sent directly to Velas in accordance with these T&C and to the following email address: office@velas.com.

18.5.  	We will not disclose your Personal data except as expressly permitted under these T&Cs and/or Applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge that we may be required to disclose your Personal data and/or certain other information about you to the extent required by Applicable laws and regulations, or by an order of a court or competent governmental or regulatory authority.

18.6.  	In order to conduct the Token swap, Velas may provide your Personal data to technical service providers and specialists. Some of those technical service providers and specialists may not be located in countries which do not provide the same level of data protection as the country of your residence. Therefore, we will always apply appropriate safeguards to additionally protect your Personal data, where applicable. Contract us is you wish to know whether your Personal data is transferred to such countries and which safeguards do we use.

18.7.  	Your Personal Data will be processed for the following purposes:


            (i)   	the processing of transactions related to the Token Swap;


            (ii)  	performance of these T&Cs;


            (iii) 	maintenance of the Black list;


            (iv)	making Velas platform available to you;


            (v) 	compliance with any requirement imposed by Applicable laws and regulations, or by an order of a court or competent governmental or regulatory authority.

18.8.  	Further processing of your Personal data within the Velas platform shall be subject to the respective privacy notice and shall not be governed by these T&C.

You also have a right to object to your Personal data being processed for the purposes of direct marketing.

18.10.   You hereby acknowledge that, by design, a record on a blockchain cannot be changed or deleted, which may affect your ability to exercise some of your rights, such as your right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”), the right to rectification of your data or object or restrict processing, of your personal data. In certain circumstances we might need to write your digital wallet address onto the blockchain network; primarily, this will be done in order to perform those obligations that require making transactions with virtual assets or certain other records on the blockchain, including, for example, in order to deliver New tokens to you hereunder and make the Velas platform available to you. If you want to ensure your privacy is not affected by the above in any way , you should not transact on blockchain, therefore, should not apply for and participate in the Token swap, as the blockchain is available to the public and any data (including Personal data) shared on the blockchain will become publicly available.


        **19.**  **RISKS**

BY ACCEPTING THESE T&Cs AND/OR APPLYING FOR AND/OR PARTICIPATING IN THE VELAS TOKEN SWAP, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE RISKS SET OUT BELOW.

19.1.  	You hereby acknowledge and agree that your participation in the Token swap, as well as the issuance, distribution, use and transfer of the New token, development, deployment and use of the Velas platform and other Velas’s products that may be introduced from time to time may carry significant potential financial, regulatory, legal, reputational and other risks, including, but not limited to:


            (i)   	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risk of software weaknesses</span>: Any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the software used in the Velas platform or for the issuance and transfer of VLX2 may have material adverse effect on VLX2, Velas platform and Velas project. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the VLX2 (including the utility of VLX2 for obtaining services) and the Velas platform, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain protocol.


            (ii)  	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regulatory risk</span>: Blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology  and blockchain technology-based applications and software. These may be contrary to the current setup and functionality of VLX and Velas platform, and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications to the Velas platform, including its termination and the loss of VLX2. Additionally, regulation of proposed activities of the Velas platform is currently uncertain and may be subject to change without notice.  In particular, the regulatory framework for the proposed Velas platform and associated activities are largely untested.  Therefore, there is uncertainty as to the legal and regulatory licences and requirements that will be required. It is also uncertain as to whether Velas will even be able to apply to be regulated, or successfully obtain the necessary licences so that it may lawfully carry out its proposed business activities.


            (iii) 	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions</span>: The regulatory status of VLX2 and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Velas platform and VLX2. It is equally difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Velas platform and VLX2. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Velas platform and VLX2 in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that VLX2 are a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing. Velas may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.


            (iv)	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risk of abandonment / lack of success</span>: The creation and issue of VLX2 and the development of the Velas platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding and lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g., caused by competing projects). There is no assurance that, even if the Velas platform is partially or fully developed and launched, the Velas project will be operating and in good standing. 


            (v) 	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risk associated with other applications</span>: Velas platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which VLX2 will have no intrinsic value and which may create competition for Velas platform.


            (vi)	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risks associated with markets for VLX2</span>: We do not enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of VLX2. This may restrict the avenues for using VLX2, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any VLX2 you own. Even if secondary trading of VLX2 is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.


        Furthermore, to the extent that any third party ascribes an external exchange value to VLX2 (for example, as denominated in a virtual assets or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.


        You accept that VLX2 is not offered by Velas or Velas Companies on an investment basis or for speculative purposes, and is intended to be consumed by you during the use of the Velas platform.


            (vii)   <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or your error</span>: VLX2 can only be accessed by using your respective digital wallet where such VLX2 are stored, with a combination of Digital wallet address and private keys, and/or a seed phrase. You acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private keys and/or seed phrase gets lost or stolen, the VLX2 associated with your Digital wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private keys and/or seed phrase, including by gaining access to the login credentials for the Velas wallet, may be able to misappropriate your VLX2. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault in which you choose to receive and store VLX2, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your VLX2.


            (viii)  <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risk of hard-fork</span>: The Velas platform will need to go through substantial development works which may result in significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. As part of the development, an upgrade to VLX2 may be required (hard-fork of VLX2 or Velas blockchain) and that, if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be able to use your VLX2 and any non-upgraded VLX2 may lose its functionality in full.


            (ix)	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">System risk</span>. You represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with the cryptographic technology and systems, and that you understand how to use the cryptographic tokens, like Bitcoin, Ether or VLX2, and distributed ledger technology software.


            (x) 	<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Risks arising from taxation</span>: The tax characterisation of VLX2 is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquisition, storage, transfer and use of VLX2, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you. This includes without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.

            (ii)         	representations or warranties provided by you hereunder have been and/or are untrue or incorrect; or


            (iii)        	an adverse or material change in circumstances relating to the Token swap, Velas platform and/or VLX2 occurs, including the change in the laws and applicable regulations, receipt by Velas of an order, claim or similar demand from a government authority or regulator relating to the Velas platform or VLX2; or


            (iv)        	this is required in order to keep Velas, Velas platform and VLX2 compliant with the applicable laws and regulations; or


            (v)         	in Velas’ reasonable opinion such termination is in the interests of the Velas’s community or Velas project.


        **21.**  **PROPER PERFORMANCE OF PRIOR OBLIGATIONS**

21.1.  	You hereby agree and acknowledge that Velas has properly and fully performed all of obligations that it had or might have had to you arising prior to the date hereof with regard to the Matters, as defined in Clause 1.1 hereof, whether such arose from a contract or otherwise, including all obligations of Velas related to the issuance, distribution, transfer or use of Current tokens, Velas token pre-sale and sale, and further confirm, acknowledge and agree that you have no claims against Velas, Velas Companies and Velas Parties with respect to the above.

        **23.**  **LAW AND ARBITRATION**

23.1.  	These T&Cs, any relationship between you and Velas with respect to the VLX2, Token swap and Velas platform, and all and any disputes arising out of or in connection therewith are constructed in accordance with and shall be governed by the Swiss laws, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.

23.2.  	Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with these T&Cs, including any question regarding their existence, validity or termination, and relationship between you and Velas with respect to the VLX2, Token swap and Velas platform (the “**Dispute**”), shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the Swiss Chambers’ Arbitration Institution (the “**Rules**”) in force on the date on which the Notice of Arbitration is submitted in accordance with these Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Zurich, Switzerland. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. By agreeing to be bound by these T&Cs, you either: (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood the Rules, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the Rules and any claim that the Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason whatsoever. If, and only if, a Dispute cannot be resolved by a binding arbitration pursuant to this Clause, for example, where the law so provides, such Dispute shall be exclusively resolved by the courts of Switzerland having authority.

23.3.  	Any Dispute shall be personal to you and Velas and will be resolved solely through an individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding in any circumstances. There will be no class or other type or representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration where an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.

23.4.  	The arbitrator shall: (i) honour claims of privilege and privacy recognised at law, (ii) only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual, and (iii) award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law, subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these T&Cs. The arbitration will be confidential, and neither Party may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.

23.5.  	Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any dispute or claim within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute or claim informally. Notice to Velas shall be sent by e-mail to office@velas.com. Notice to you shall be sent to any address you provide to us in writing, through the Website or in your communication; where the foregoing is not possible, the notice may be published on the Website or delivered to you via other means deemed appropriate by Velas. Your notice must include your personal details, including name, postal address, email address and telephone number, a reasonably detailed description of the nature and basis of the dispute or claim, and the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Velas cannot agree how to resolve the dispute or claim within thirty (30) days after the date the notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Velas may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Article 23, commence an arbitration proceeding.

23.6.  	Provisions of these T&Cs regarding the binding arbitration shall not apply to claims or disputes in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful disclosure of confidential information, use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.

23.7.  	Due to the unique nature of the Parties relationships, monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Velas for any breach by you of your covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, the Parties each agree and acknowledge that any such violation or threatened violation may cause irreparable injury to Velas and, in addition to any other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise, Velas shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of these T&Cs, or the continuation of any such breach by you or by your Representatives.


        **24.**  **CONFIDENTIALITY**

            (ii)  	any information regarding the relationship between the Parties, conditions of the such relationship and of its termination, financial and business information related thereto;


            (iii) 	any other information relative to any of the foregoing and disclosed on an explicit or implicit condition of confidentiality prior to the date hereof.

24.2.  	You undertake to, and shall procure that your Representatives will, keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential in accordance with the terms of these T&Cs. Except as permitted by these T&Cs, you and your Representatives shall not disclose (a) the fact that the Confidential Information has been provided to you or was otherwise received by you, (b) the terms or the existence of any other agreements and arrangements entered into or to be entered into between the Parties, (c) any communications, notices and calls with the participation of Velas, Velas Companies or Velas Parties, (d) any other information which may be reasonably considered as confidential.
